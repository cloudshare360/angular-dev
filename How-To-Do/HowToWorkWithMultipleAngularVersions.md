Working with multiple Angular version-based projects on the same machine is **totally doable**, but you'll need to manage different versions of the **Angular CLI** and possibly **Node.js** too.

Hereâ€™s a clean way to handle it:

---

## âœ… 1. Use `npx` to Run Specific Angular CLI Versions Per Project

You can use `npx` to run the correct CLI version **without installing it globally**:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng new my-angular5-app
```

Or, if the project already exists:

```bash
cd my-angular5-app
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng serve
```

This way, you avoid version conflicts entirely.

---

## âœ… 2. Install Angular CLI Locally per Project

Instead of using global CLI, install the version you need **in each project**:

```bash
npm install @angular/cli@1.5.0 --save-dev
```

Then run commands using `npx` or through `package.json` scripts:

```bash
npx ng serve
```

---

## âœ… 3. Use `nvm` to Manage Multiple Node Versions

Older Angular versions (like Angular 5) often need older Node.js versions. Use `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to switch between Node versions:

### Install `nvm`:
- **macOS/Linux**: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- **Windows**: Use [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

### Example commands:

```bash
nvm install 8
nvm use 8
```

---

## âœ… 4. Use `volta` for Simpler Tooling (Alternative to nvm)

[Volta](https://volta.sh) pins Node, npm, and CLI tools **per project**, automatically. Great for keeping each Angular app isolated.

---

## âœ… 5. Pro Tips

- Use different terminals or shell tabs for running different Angular versions.
- Add version info in each projectâ€™s `README.md` for clarity.
- Set up project-specific Node/Angular versions in `.nvmrc` and `.npmrc` (optional but helpful).

Let me know what versions you're working with â€” I can help you craft the exact setup.

Great question! When you're using `npx` with a specific version of Angular CLI (like Angular 5's CLI), you can still use **all the regular CLI commands** â€” including generating components, directives, services, etc.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

---

### âœ… General Syntax with `npx`

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli@<version> ng generate <schematic> <name>
```

For Angular 5, use CLI version 1.5.0:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng generate component my-component
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng generate directive my-directive
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng generate service my-service
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng generate pipe my-pipe
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng generate module my-module
```

---

### âš¡ Inside a Project with Local CLI

If your project already has a **local CLI installed**, you can just do:

```bash
npx ng generate component my-component
```

The CLI version used will be the one defined in `node_modules`.

---

### ðŸ›  Example: Generate a Component in Angular 5 Project

```bash
cd my-angular5-app
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng generate component user/profile
```

This will create:

```
src/app/user/profile/profile.component.ts
src/app/user/profile/profile.component.html
src/app/user/profile/profile.component.css
src/app/user/profile/profile.component.spec.ts
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Tips

- You can use `--flat` if you donâ€™t want a subfolder.
- Use `--module=app` to auto-import the component into `app.module.ts`.
  
```bash
npx -p @angular/cli@1.5.0 ng g c login --flat --module=app
```
