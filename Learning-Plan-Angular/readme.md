   - Small Business CMS (e.g., clone of [www.aasoftnet.com](http://www.aasoftnet.com))
     - Multi-page structure with editable content
     - Admin login to update page content
     - Preview (beta) mode with versioning
     - Deployment pipeline

### ✅ Testing & Quality Assurance
3. Write **unit tests** (Jasmine/Karma) and **integration/E2E tests** (Cypress or Playwright).
4. Understand testing best practices: component isolation, service mocking, test coverage.

### ✅ DevOps & Deployment
5. Implement **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or GitLab CI).
6. Deploy apps to **major cloud platforms**:
   - Firebase Hosting
   - Vercel / Netlify
   - AWS Amplify
   - Azure Static Web Apps

### ✅ Interview & Career Readiness
7. Prepare with **Angular-specific interview questions**.
8. Maintain **cheat sheets** for quick revision (RxJS, Signals, DI, Routing, etc.).
9. Showcase **3–4 meaningful, deployed projects** with clean code, documentation, and GitHub presence.

### ✅ Validation & Feedback Loop
10. At every stage, **validate learning** through:
    - Code reviews (self or peer)
    - Automated test passing
    - Project demos
    - Mini quizzes or flashcards

## 🗓️ **Optimized 6-Week Learning Plan (3 Hours/Day)**

> ⏱️ **Total**: ~90–120 hours  
> 🎯 **Goal**: Build 4 production-grade apps, master testing + deployment, ace mid-level interviews.

---

### **Week 1: Angular 18 Fundamentals + Portfolio Site**
**Focus**: Core concepts → Immediate output  
**Daily Breakdown**:
- **Concepts**: Standalone components, Signals (reactive primitives), `@angular/cli`, component architecture, templates, directives, pipes.
- **Hands-On**: Build a responsive **Portfolio Website** (home, about, projects, contact).
- **Validation**:
  - Deploy to Netlify/Firebase
  - Add dark mode toggle using Signals
  - Write 3+ unit tests for components

> ✅ **Deliverable**: Live portfolio with GitHub repo + test coverage report.

---

### **Week 2: Routing, State, Forms & Employee App**
**Focus**: User interaction & data flow  
**Daily Breakdown**:
- **Concepts**: Angular Router (guards, lazy loading), reactive forms, `inject()` (no `constructor` DI), services with `providedIn: 'root'`, RxJS basics (optional—Signals preferred in v18).
- **Hands-On**: Build **Employee Management System** (CRUD: list, add, edit, delete).
- **Validation**:
  - Form validation with error messages
  - Route guards for edit pages
  - Unit tests for form logic & services

> ✅ **Deliverable**: Fully functional employee app with form validation + routing.

---

### **Week 3: Advanced Patterns + Shopping Cart**
**Focus**: Real-world complexity  
**Daily Breakdown**:
- **Concepts**: Component communication (input/output, signals), HTTP client, interceptors, error handling, environment config.
- **Hands-On**: Build **Shopping Cart** with:
  - Product listing (mock API or JSON server)
  - Cart state (using signals or lightweight service)
  - Checkout flow
- **Validation**:
  - Mock API calls in tests
  - Test cart add/remove logic
  - Responsive UI (mobile-first)

> ✅ **Deliverable**: Shopping cart with cart persistence (localStorage) and tests.

---

### **Week 4: CMS for Small Business (e.g., aasoftnet.com Clone)**
**Focus**: Auth + dynamic content + preview  
**Daily Breakdown**:
- **Analyze** [www.aasoftnet.com](http://www.aasoftnet.com):
  - Pages: Home, Services, About, Contact, Portfolio
  - Static content with images, testimonials, CTAs
- **Build**:
  - Admin login (use Firebase Auth or mock JWT)
  - WYSIWYG or form-based editor per page
  - Save content to JSON/local DB or Firebase
  - “Preview” mode showing beta version with version number (e.g., v1.2-beta)
- **Validation**:
  - Role-based access (admin vs visitor)
  - Content updates reflected in preview
  - Versioning logic (store snapshots)

> ✅ **Deliverable**: Deployed CMS with login, edit, preview, and versioning.

---

### **Week 5: Testing Deep Dive + CI/CD**
**Focus**: Quality & automation  
**Daily Breakdown**:
- **Unit Testing**: Test components, services, pipes with Jasmine/Karma
- **E2E Testing**: Cypress for user flows (login → edit → preview)
- **CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Actions: run tests on PR
  - Auto-deploy to Firebase/Vercel on `main` push
- **Validation**:
  - >80% test coverage
  - Passing CI pipeline
  - Zero manual deployment steps

> ✅ **Deliverable**: All projects with CI/CD + test reports.

---

### **Week 6: Interview Prep + Portfolio Polish**
**Focus**: Job readiness  
**Daily Breakdown**:
- **Cheat Sheets**:
  - Angular Signals vs RxJS
  - Change detection strategies
  - Dependency injection hierarchy
  - Standalone vs NgModule (v18 best practices)
- **Interview Practice**:
  - 50+ Angular interview Q&A (focus: v16–v18)
  - System design: “How would you structure a large Angular app?”
- **Portfolio Finalization**:
  - READMEs with screenshots, tech stack, live links
  - GitHub pinned repos
  - LinkedIn/GitHub profile update

> ✅ **Deliverable**: Ready-to-apply profile with 4 projects, cheat sheets, and mock interview confidence.

## 🔍 **Key Angular 18 Features Emphasized**
- ✅ **Standalone Components** (default in new projects)
- ✅ **Signals** (simpler reactivity than RxJS for most use cases)
- ✅ **`inject()`** function (constructor-less DI)
- ✅ **Deferrable Views** (`@defer` for lazy loading UI)
- ✅ **ESBuild-based dev server** (faster builds)

> 💡 **Note**: RxJS is still used for HTTP and complex streams—but Signals reduce its necessity for local state.
