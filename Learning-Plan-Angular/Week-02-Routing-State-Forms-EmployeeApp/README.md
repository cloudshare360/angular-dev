# Week 2: Routing, State, Forms & Employee App

**Focus**: User interaction & data flow  
**Duration**: 7 days Ã— 3 hours/day = 21 hours  
**Goal**: Master Angular routing, forms, services, and build a full CRUD employee management system

By the end of this week, you will:
- âœ… Implement routing with guards and lazy loading
- âœ… Build reactive forms with validation
- âœ… Use dependency injection with `inject()` function
- âœ… Create and consume services with `providedIn: 'root'`
- âœ… Understand RxJS basics (Observable, Subject, operators)
- âœ… Build a fully functional Employee Management System (CRUD)
- âœ… Write unit tests for forms and services

## ðŸŽ¯ Project: Employee Management System

### Features
- **Employee List**: Display all employees with search/filter
- **Add Employee**: Form to create new employee records

- Reactive Forms (no template-driven)
- Services with `inject()`
- RxJS for async data flow
- JSON Server or HttpClient with mock data
- Jasmine/Karma for testing
