# Quick Reference - Restoring Context & Continuing Work

**For AI Agents & Developers**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: Resuming Work

### Step 1: Check Overall Status (30 seconds)
```bash
# Read the progress tracker first
cat Learning-Plan-Angular/.meta/progress-tracker.md
```
**Look for**: Current week status, what's completed, what's next

---

### Step 2: Understand Recent History (1 minute)
```bash
# Read the conversation log
cat Learning-Plan-Angular/.meta/conversation-log.md
```
**Look for**: Last few requests, decisions made, pending actions

---

### Step 3: Load Full Context (AI Agents only)
```bash
# Read context memory for AI restoration
cat Learning-Plan-Angular/.meta/context-memory.json
```
**Contains**: Full project structure, technical stack, user preferences, AI instructions

---

### Step 4: Continue Work
- Check `nextAction` in `context-memory.json`
- Execute the next batch of tasks
- Update all tracking files when done

---

## 📋 Current State Summary (As of 2025-10-20)

### ✅ Completed
- Week 1: All 7 days with comprehensive README files
- Tracking system: All metadata files created

### ⏳ Pending
- Weeks 2-6: Need folder structure and content
- Root README: Need navigation links
- Quality checks: Verify all files

### 🎯 Next Action
**Create Week 2 folder structure and day-by-day content**

---

## 📁 Key Files to Read

| File | Purpose | Read Time | When to Use |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `progress-tracker.md` | Visual dashboard | 30 sec | Always start here |
| `conversation-log.md` | Narrative history | 2 min | Understand decisions |
| `context-memory.json` | AI context | 1 min | Agent restoration |
| `session-tracker.json` | Structured data | 1 min | Query specific info |

---

## 🔄 Update Workflow

### After Creating Files
1. Add file paths to `session-tracker.json` → `outputs` array
2. Append entry to `conversation-log.md` with timestamp
3. Update `context-memory.json` → `currentState.filesCreated`
4. Update `progress-tracker.md` checkboxes and percentages

### After Completing a Week
1. Mark week as "completed" in all tracking files
2. Update progress percentages
3. Move to next week in `nextAction`

### After Each Session
1. Set `endTime` in `session-tracker.json`
2. Add session summary to `conversation-log.md`
3. Commit all `.meta/` files to Git

## 🎨 Folder Naming Conventions

```
Week-##-Topic-Name/
├── README.md                    # Week overview
├── Day-##-Topic-Name/
│   └── README.md                # Day lesson plan
└── exercises/                   # Optional: Exercise files
```

**Example**:
- `Week-02-Routing-Forms-Employee/`
- `Day-01-Angular-Router-Basics/`

---

## 📝 README Content Structure

Every day's README should include:
1. **Learning Objectives** (bullet points)
2. **Topics Covered** (sections with code examples)
3. **Hands-On Exercises** (3-5 practical tasks)
4. **Resources** (links to docs and tutorials)
5. **End of Day Checklist** (checkboxes for completion)

---

## 💡 Tips for Continuity

### For AI Agents
- Always read `context-memory.json` first
- Follow `aiInstructions.onRestore` steps
- Update all tracking files after each batch
- Maintain consistent folder/file naming

### For Developers
- Check `progress-tracker.md` before starting work
- Read `conversation-log.md` to understand context
- Update tracking files manually if needed
- Commit `.meta/` directory frequently

---

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "I don't know what was done last"
**Solution**: Read `conversation-log.md` from bottom up

### Issue: "Which files need to be created?"
**Solution**: Check `progress-tracker.md` for ⏳ pending items

### Issue: "What's the next priority?"
**Solution**: Look at `context-memory.json` → `currentState.nextAction`

### Issue: "Files seem out of sync"
**Solution**: Check Git history, restore last known good state

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

By the end of this project, you should have:
- ✅ 6 week folders (42 day folders total)
- ✅ ~50 README.md files
- ✅ All tracking files updated and synchronized
- ✅ Root README with navigation links
- ✅ Comprehensive learning content for 90-120 hours

## 📞 Need Help?

1. **Context lost?** → Read `.meta/conversation-log.md`
2. **Don't know what's next?** → Read `.meta/progress-tracker.md`
3. **AI needs full context?** → Read `.meta/context-memory.json`
4. **Need structured data?** → Read `.meta/session-tracker.json`
